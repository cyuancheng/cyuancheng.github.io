[Identify Customer Segments (Unsupervised Learning)](https://github.com/cyuancheng/Identify_Customer_Segments/blob/master/Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb)

Used unsupervised learning (PCA and Kmeans) to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. By comparing general population and customers population, the identified segments could be targets for future marketing campaigns or to be considered outside of company interests.

### Deep Learning

[Predict Stock Price with Buy or Sell Signal](https://github.com/cyuancheng/Stock_Prediction/blob/master/ETF_QQQ_CrossSignal.ipynb)

Built a LSTM model on stock data and technical indicators to predict market movement with 70% accuracy. This is a capstone project working together with AI enthusiasts of [the Princeton School of AI](https://www.meetup.com/Princeton-School-of-AI/) in summer 2019. My role in the team is to develop and refine the time-series model using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
